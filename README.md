# Overview

Dusklight is a reverse-engineered reimplementation of Twilight Princess.

It aims to be as accurate as possible to the original while also providing new options, enhancements, and tools to customize your experience.

# Setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Dusklight does *not* provide any copyrighted assets. You must provide your own copy of the original game.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> At a minimum, Dusklight requires a GPU with support for D3D12, Vulkan 1.1+, or Metal. For older devices, best-effort support is provided for D3D11 and OpenGL ES (Android), but will not achieve full accuracy or performance. Your experience with specific hardware, operating systems, and drivers may vary.

### 1. Dump your game

You must dump your own copy of the game. Please see [this article](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Ripping_Games) for instructions. After dumping, you can use a program like [Dolphin](https://dolphin-emu.org/) or [nodtool](https://github.com/encounter/nod/releases) to convert the `.iso` to `.rvz` to save space.

Currently, only the GameCube USA and EUR releases are supported. Support for other versions of the game is planned in the future.

### 2. Install Dusklight

Visit the [official installation guide](https://twilitrealm.dev/install/) for full instructions.

# Building

If you'd like to build Dusklight from source, please read the [build instructions](docs/building.md).
